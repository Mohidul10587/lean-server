/**
 * One-time fix script for double balance deduction bug.
 *
 * The bug: When a withdraw was Approved, the amount was deducted TWICE —
 * once at request creation, and again in updateStatus (Approved block).
 *
 * This script finds all affected approved withdrawals and refunds the
 * extra deduction back to each user's wallet.
 *
 * Run once: npx ts-node scripts/fixDoubleDeduction.ts
